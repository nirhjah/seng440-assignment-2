# SENG440 Assignment 2

UCanScan is aimed at first-year university students or high school leavers who want to explore the University of Canterburyâ€™s campus in a fun way. Students are able to find and collect landmarks at UC in a certain order in a personal amazing race, aiming for the shortest time to complete the course. Following a campus map, students can scan codes physically posted at each landmark to mark its discovery in-app. Once the course is fully completed, they can share their times on social media or look at their history of personal best times.
